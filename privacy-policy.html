    <h1>Privacy Policy for Image to Text</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 31, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Image to Text (the "Application") respects your privacy. We do not require you to create an account, we do not log your activity, and we do not collect your personal data. The Application processes images strictly for the purpose of Optical Character Recognition (OCR).</p>
    </div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service. By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>

    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>The words whose initial letters are capitalised have meanings defined under the following conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.</p>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Application</strong> refers to Image to Text, the software program provided by the Company.</li>
        <li><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Privacy Policy) refers to Image to Text.</li>
        <li><strong>Country</strong> refers to: Andhra Pradesh, India.</li>
        <li><strong>Device</strong> means any device that can access the Service such as a computer, a cell phone, or a digital tablet.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.</li>
        <li><strong>Service</strong> refers to the Application.</li>
        <li><strong>You</strong> means the individual accessing or using the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>

    <h3>No Personal Data Collection</h3>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Usage Data. You do not need to create an account to use the Application.</p>

    <h3>Device Permissions</h3>
    <p>While using Our Application, we require specific permissions to perform the core function of the app (Optical Character Recognition). These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the app and not for data collection.</p>

    <h4>1. Camera Access</h4>
    <p>The Application requires access to your Device's camera to capture images of documents or text for OCR processing. Images captured are processed instantly to extract text and are not uploaded to Our servers unless explicitly required for a specific cloud-processing feature you initiate. Typically, processing is done locally on your device.</p>

    <h4>2. Photo Library / Gallery Access</h4>
    <p>The Application requires access to your photo library to allow you to select existing images for text extraction. We only access the specific images you select.</p>

    <h3>Data Retention</h3>
    <p>Because we do not collect your Personal Data or transmit it to external servers for storage, there is no data retention period. Any image scanned or text generated remains on your local Device until you decide to delete it.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any Personal Data, we do not disclose your data to law enforcement, third parties, or business partners.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone, including children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data (which should not be possible given our app's design), please contact Us so that we can take necessary actions.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third-party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
    <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
